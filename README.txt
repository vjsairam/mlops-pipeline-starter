Purpose

A production-ready template for continuous training & continuous delivery (CT/CD) of ML models: data validation, feature pipelines, experiment tracking, model registry, CI/CD to real-time inference (REST/gRPC) with canary rollouts and drift monitoring.

Outcomes (Executive)

Reproducible training and auditable promotions to prod.

Canary deployments with automatic rollback on quality or SLO breach.

Full lineage: data → features → model → serving artifacts.

Scope
Features

Data/Feature pipeline: Ingest + validate (Great Expectations), feature engineering (Feature Store adapter: Feast/Tecton/Snowflake features).

Experiment & Registry: MLflow or Vertex/SageMaker registry; model cards with metrics and constraints.

Training Orchestration: Airflow/Kubeflow Pipelines; versioned datasets (DVC/Delta/BigQuery).

Evaluation & Policy: Acceptance gates (e.g., AUC/latency fairness thresholds); signed artifacts (Cosign); SLSA provenance.

Serving: vLLM/TorchServe/BentoML; blue/green or canary via Argo Rollouts; shadow tests.

Monitoring: Data drift, concept drift (Evidently/Custom), latency, error rate; OTel traces linking request → model version → features.

Rollback: Auto rollback on metric/SLO breach; one-click revert via GitOps.

Non-Functional

Reproducibility: Model build is deterministic given commit + data snapshot.

Latency: p95 target configurable; default <250ms for CPU baseline.

Compliance: Model card + registry metadata required for promotion.

Architecture

Pipelines: Airflow/KFP for train/eval/promote.

Storage: Object store for datasets/artifacts; registry for models; feature store optional.

CD: GitOps (ArgoCD) + Argo Rollouts; canary weighted by RPS.

Obs: Prometheus/Grafana + OTel; Evidently for drift.

Deliverables

pipelines/ (train/eval/promote DAGs)

serving/ (container, manifests, Rollouts)

observability/ (OTel, dashboards)

mlops/ (MLflow utils, registry promotion scripts)

security/ (Cosign, SLSA provenance)

docs/ (playbooks: promote, rollback, audit)

Acceptance Tests

Full CT/CD run from dataset → prod with a toy model.

Canary: 10% traffic for 30 min; auto-rollback on p95 or accuracy drop.

Drift detector fires on synthetic schema/feature shift; alert opens Jira.

Roadmap (8–10 weeks)

W1–2: Pipeline skeleton + MLflow + dataset versioning.

W3–4: Serving container + Argo Rollouts + canary + shadow.

W5: OTel + drift monitors + dashboards.

W6–7: Promotion policy + signed artifacts + audit trail.

W8–9: Hardening, docs, demo script; “one-click” bootstrap.

Resume Bullets

Delivered CT/CD for ML with canary rollouts and automatic rollback on drift/SLO breach, integrating MLflow registry and GitOps.

Implemented SLSA-compliant model supply chain (signed artifacts, provenance) with full lineage and auditability.
